	abstract = {The objectives of this study are: (1) to specify evacuation return and home-switch stability as two critical milestones of short-term recovery during and in the aftermath of disasters; and (2) to understand the disparities among subpopulations in the duration of these critical recovery milestones. Using privacy-preserving fine-resolution location-based data, we examine evacuation return and home move-out rates in Harris County, Texas in the context of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey. For each of the two critical recovery milestones, the results reveal the areas with short- and long-return durations and enable evaluating disparities in evacuation return and home-switch stability patterns. In fact, a shorter duration of critical recovery milestone indicators in flooded areas is not necessarily a positive indication. Shorter evacuation return could be due to barriers to evacuation and shorter home move-out rate return for lower-income residents is associated with living in rental homes. In addition, skewed and non-uniform recovery patterns for both the evacuation return and home-switch stability were observed in all subpopulation groups. All return patterns show a two-phase return progress pattern. The findings could inform disaster managers and public officials to perform recovery monitoring and resource allocation in a more proactive, data-driven, and equitable manner.},

	abstract = {Aggregated community-scale data could be harnessed to allow insights into the disparate impacts of managed power outages, burst pipes, and food inaccessibility during extreme weather events. During Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, Texas power-generating plant operators resorted to rolling blackouts to prevent wider collapse of the whole power grid when power demand overwhelmed supply. In this study, we collected community-scale big data (e.g., digital trace and crowdsourced data) in the context of the winter storm, which brought historically low temperatures, snow, and ice to the entire state of Texas. By analyzing this data, we can infer the extent of disparities in storm-related impacts on vulnerable populations. In addition to assessing disparate impacts of the managed power outage, this study also examined the extent of burst pipes and disrupted access to food. Using statistical and trend classification analyses, the results highlight the spatial and temporal patterns of impacts for subpopulations in Harris County, Texas, within which the city of Houston is located. In particular, findings show significant disparity in the extent and duration of power outages experienced by low-income and minority groups. This finding suggests that the existence of inequality in the management and implementation of the power outage. Also, the extent of burst pipes and disrupted food access were more severe for low-income and minority groups. These findings suggest implications for understanding the disparate impacts of extreme weather events on vulnerable populations; in particular, the findings could provide insights allowing infrastructure operators to enhance social equality considerations during managed service disruptions in such events. The results and findings demonstrate the value of community-scale big data sources for rapid impact assessment in the aftermath of extreme weather events.},

	abstract = {Surface drainage at the neighborhood and street scales plays an important role in conveying stormwater and mitigating urban flooding. Surface drainage at the local scale is often ignored due to the lack of up-to-date fine-scale topographical information. This paper addresses this issue by providing a novel method for evaluating surface drainage at the neighborhood and street scales based on mobile lidar (light detection and ranging) measurements. The developed method derives topographical properties and runoff accumulation by applying a semantic segmentation (SS) model (a computer vision technique) and a flow direction model (a hydrology technique) to lidar data. Fifty lidar images representing 50 street blocks were used to train, validate, and test the SS model. Based on the test dataset, the SS model has 80.3\% IoU and 88.5\% accuracy. The results suggest that the proposed method can effectively evaluate surface drainage conditions at both the neighborhood and street scales and identify problematic low points that could be susceptible to water ponding. Municipalities and property owners can use this information to take targeted corrective maintenance actions.},

This process requires mathematical models capable of predicting bridge condition over multiyear planning horizons taking into account the long-term performance effects of M\&R treatments. This paper describes the development, validation, and application of Markov chainâ€“based bridge deterioration prediction models. Bridge condition is measured in terms of the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) deck rating, superstructure rating, substructure rating, and culvert rating. The models consider explanatory variables that affect bridge deterioration, including climate/environment, traffic loading, material type, and M\&R type. Because data on M\&R work history are often disconnected from bridge condition data, the study used a novel approach that allows for inferring past M\&R type and timing based on changes in bridge condition ratings. The models were developed using condition data for 43,320 bridges across Texas extending from 2001 to 2017. The developed prediction models can be used as a tool to support bridge asset management planning in Texas. The modeling approach, however, can be used by transportation agencies across the world to develop bridge deterioration prediction models using their local empirical data.},

	abstract = {Roadside channel systems are critical for the management of stormwater runoff and the protection of the structural integrity of roads; and thus, require systematic evaluation and maintenance. However, the evaluation of these systems remains ad hoc due to the lack of efficient inspection methods. This paper contributes to filling this gap by providing an automated process for the inspection and evaluation of roadside channel systems using data obtained from mobile lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) scanners. The Cloth Simulation Filtering algorithm was employed to split lidar point clouds into bare earth and object datasets, and then compute six key attributes of roadside channels based on the bare earth dataset. The six attributes are: channel depth, bottom width, side slope, longitudinal slope, and length and density of subsurface pipes and culverts. To test and demonstrate the new automated process, it was applied to six street sections in the City of Houston, Texas. The computed attributes were compared to the design and maintenance guidelines set by the City of Houston and Harris County. The evaluation results indicate that every channel examined in this study has its own condition issues and improvement needs. While no channel section in this study was in full compliance with the guidelines, no channel was utterly incompatible either. The results show that the developed automated process can effectively and efficiently evaluate roadside channels, providing an alternative to conventional manual inspection methods. Future work could use the output of the developed method to assess the risk of localized flooding and inform both the municipal government and property owners about effective mitigation measures.},

	abstract = {Skid resistance measurement is one of the major measurements used to assess road safety. Typical devices used for measuring skid resistance include single point checking type and continuous measurements type. However, conducting periodic full roadway network skid resistance survey can be a relatively time consuming and difficult task because of the limited water carrying capacity used by all kinds of devices, including the continuous types. On the contrary, measurement of pavement surface texture can be conducted easily and continuously by most profilers. This research investigates the relation between pavement skid resistance and surface texture. The focus is on the development of a texture index that can serve as a screening indicator to filter out the high-risk pavement sections for further skid resistance measurement. Two measuring devices, {GripTester} ({GT}) and National Taiwan University laser profiler ({NTU} Profiler), were used to collect data on pavement skid resistance and texture in a network of 555 sections, respectively. The pavement texture index of the mean difference of elevation ({MDE}) is calculated at a 1mm profile interval, which is a very promising indicator to represent pavement skid resistance. Through a sensitivity study, the {MDE} threshold of 0.15mm is observed to provide a relatively reasonable screening function that filters out 29.01\% of the entire surveyed network for further skid resistance inspection. It averted more than 70\% skid resistance measurement capacity of the entire network. The accuracy of correct judgment by the selected threshold is about 80\%, only 3.78\% of roadway sections considered for further inspection of the recommended list are not included.},

	abstract = {Inertial profilers have been the mainstream measuring device for pavement roughness for decades, but many local government agencies still use profilographs and other simple measuring devices due to the relatively high cost of inertial profilers. Recently, researchers have shown great interest in studying smartphones and other types of inexpensive devices for roughness measurements. In this study, a portable response-based measuring device was developed, followed by a computational algorithm to enhance the analysis procedure of measured acceleration data. The algorithm includes speed normalization on acceleration data, Fourier transform, and low-pass and high-pass filtering on acceleration data in a frequency domain. The enhanced acceleration root-mean-square index ({ARI}) is then computed. Four test sections of 5.4-km long were surveyed by the developed device and inertial profiler mounted on the same vehicle at eight various speeds. It was found that the low-pass cutoff frequency corresponding to a 7.5-m wavelength and the high-pass cutoff frequency corresponding to a 30-m wavelength resulted in the best {ARI} calculation. The developed algorithm was successfully verified by an additional field survey of 169 subsections. The coefficient of determination R2 between the {ARI} and international roughness index ({IRI}) has been significantly improved from 0.502 to 0.881 after the enhancement procedure was conducted. Therefore, the pavement roughness {IRI} value can be reasonably estimated by an economic, portable, and reliable device. However, the potential errors due to vehicle sources should be further investigated for enhancing the practical application.},

A test bicycle equipped with multiple sensors was developed in this study to measure the vertical acceleration while riding a bicycle. A lightweight inertial profiler was also designed and manufactured for measuring the bicycle route profile, which was used as the major input of the analysis model. Through several stages of field tests, it was concluded that the measured and calculated accelerations are fairly consistent, and the average error percentage is less than 10\%. By integrating the usage of a lightweight inertial profiler and the bicycle motion analysis model, riding smoothness of bicycle route networks can be assessed effectively and efficiently.},

	rights = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {Assessing drainage conditions at the neighborhood level can help public works agencies to develop maintenance plans and mitigation strategies to guard against pluvial floods. Drainage condition assessments can also inform property owners about possible drainage problem areas. Current drainage condition assessment methods have two important shortcomings: (a) they depend on manual visual inspection, which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, and (b) they ignore areas outside the street right-of-way (e.g., adjacent front yards), despite the interdependency between public drainage system (e.g., roadside channel) and adjacent private properties. To address these shortcomings, this dissertation aims to develop automated methods for assessing the drainage conditions of roadside channels and adjacent land in residential areas by using mobile lidar (Light Detection and Ranging). Mobile lidar is increasingly used for evaluating infrastructure systems due to its ability to provide high-density and high-quality spatial measurements. This dissertation is organized into three technical papers. The first paper provides an automated process for inspecting and evaluating roadside channel systems using data obtained from mobile lidar. The Cloth Simulation Filtering algorithm was employed to split lidar point clouds into bare earth and object datasets. Six key geometrical attributes of roadside channels were computed and analyzed based on the bare earth dataset using statistical and heuristic methods. These geometrical attributes were compared to design and performance manuals to determine deficiencies and inform maintenance decisions. In the second paper, roadside topography was modeled to evaluate surface drainage conditions by incorporating semantic segmentation and flow direction determination using mobile lidar data. The semantic segmentation model identifies the topographic features of lidar images by labeling each pixel as roadside channel, road, or adjacent land. Through the flow direction determination technique, major end points that are away from the roadside channels were identified as problematic low points that could be vulnerable to water ponding. In the third paper, the developed methods were applied to two communities in Harris county (Sunnyside community) and Aransas county (Rockport community) in Texas, with a total street length of 4.67 centerline miles. The six geometrical attributes for channel conditions and two attributes for off-channel conditions were evaluated and compared in the case studies. Overall, this dissertation shows that the developed automated process can evaluate roadside channels and model the roadside topography effectively. The developed methods provide actionable information to both property owners (to address potential off-channel ponding issues) and the municipal authorities (to address channel issues) to mitigate against localized flooding, water ponding, and stormwater-related hazards.},

Because of the better relation with the skid resistance, this study used MDE as the pavement texture index in further analysis. This research studied the relation between pavement skid resistance and the surface texture. The focus was on the development of a texture index which can serve as a screening indicator to filter out the high risk pavement sections for further skid resistance measurement. This study divided total 5,550 meters into 80% and 20% randomly, which was used to discuss, analyze and set the MDE threshold and to validate the result of 80%, respectively. Through a sensitivity study of the 80% data, it was found that the MDE threshold of 0.15mm can provide a relatively reasonable screening function that filters out 30.63% of the entire surveyed network for further skid resistance inspection. It averted about 70% skid resistance measurement capacity of the entire network. The accuracy of judgment by the selected threshold was more than 75%; only 4.05% of roadway sections that were considered for further inspection of the recommended list needed not be included. The sensitivity study of the rest 20% data shows the similar result to it of the 80% data that the percentage change in four quadrants is stable which is not influenced by different road section. This result shows the method of using MDE as threshold to filter out the low skid resistance roadway segments for further inspection is practical.},
